Citus supports INSERT ... SELECT queries either by pushing down the whole query to the
worker nodes or pulling the SELECT part to the coordinator. If the query can not be
pushed down to the worker nodes, two different approaches can be followed depending on
whether ON CONFLICT or RETURNING clauses are used.

	- If ON CONFLICT or RETURNING are not used, Citus uses COPY command to handle such
	  queries. After planning SELECT part of the INSERT ... SELECT query, including
	  subqueries and CTEs, it executes the plan and send results back to the
	  DestReceiver which is created using the target table info.

	- Since COPY command does not support neither ON CONFLICT nor RETURNING clauses,
	  Citus perform INSERT ... SELECT queries with ON CONFLICT or RETURNING clause
	  in two phases. First, Citus plans the SELECT part of the query, executes the
	  plan and saves results to the intermediate table which is colocated with target
	  table of the INSERT ... SELECT query. Then, INSERT ... SELECT query is directly
	  run on the worker node using the intermediate table as the source table.
