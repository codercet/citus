-- Citus uses ssl by default now. It does so by turning on ssl and if needed generate self
-- signed certificates.
-- To test this we will verify that SSL is set to ON for all machines, and we will make
-- sure connections to workers use SSL by having it required in citus.conn_nodeinfo and
-- lastly we will inspect the ssl state for connections to the workers
-- we only enable ssl during our tests on 10 and above due to a required restart in pg 9
